# Pipeline data_processing

## Overview

This pipeline processes the data of several publicly availible databases containing hemolytic activity values for peptides.
After the data is often converted from a string sentence containing the info, and always end in a %float of activity at a micromolar float for the concentration.


## Pipeline inputs
Hemolytik formated data
DBAASP formated data
DRAMP formated data
DADP formated data

## Pipeline outputs
single datafram containing all the combined values with the source of their data.
